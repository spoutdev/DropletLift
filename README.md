## What is Spout?
Spout is an open source multi-threaded Java voxel game framework and platform that opens the doors for infinite possibilities and expansion at the fingertips of gamers. Through the use of our platform, Spout and its API, developers can create "game" plugins, which use our client and server platform as a base. Players will be able to swap between games on-the-fly as they switch to a server running a different game plugin, or a set of game plugins.
